Dylan updated this Galveston building inventory. 
Changes include:
- added foundation height column (found_ht; m.) that is foundation height above ground.
- relocated some buildings that were located in NOAA's 0m SLR raster. The buildings were re-located to their nearest position that is outside of the water.
